## 🎯 Overview

High-efficiency arbitrage contract exploiting price differences across decentralized exchanges using AAVE flash loans. The contract executes triangular arbitrage between two DEX platforms in a single atomic transaction.

## 🔄 Arbitrage Flow

```
🏦 AAVE Flash Loan
     ↓
💱 DEX A: Pool 1 → Pool 2  
     ↓
💱 DEX B: Pool 3
     ↓
💰 Profit Extraction
     ↓
🔄 Flash Loan Repayment
```

## ⚙️ Architecture

### Core Concept
- **Two pools** on DEX A connected by a shared token
- **Third pool** on DEX B containing the disconnected token pair
- **Arbitrage opportunity** emerges from price discrepancies between exchanges

### Exchange Topology
```
DEX A: [Token X ↔ Token Y] + [Token Y ↔ Token Z]
DEX B: [Token X ↔ Token Z]
```

When `DEX A(X→Y→Z) ≠ DEX B(X→Z)`, profitable arbitrage exists.

## 🚀 Execution Strategy

1. **Flash Loan Initiation**: Borrow Token X from AAVE
2. **DEX A Trading**: Execute X→Y→Z conversion through connected pools
3. **DEX B Trading**: Convert Z back to X at different rate
4. **Profit Realization**: Extract arbitrage profit
5. **Loan Settlement**: Repay flash loan + fees

## 📋 Technical Specifications

### Key Features
- ⚡ **Zero Capital Required**: Utilizes AAVE flash loans
- 🎯 **Atomic Execution**: All operations in single transaction
- 💎 **Gas Optimized**: Minimal codebase for maximum efficiency
- 🔒 **Hardcoded Addresses**: Pre-validated pool addresses for optimal performance

## 🛡️ Safety Considerations

The contract operates under these assumptions:
- Pool addresses are pre-validated and hardcoded
- Arbitrage opportunities are detected off-chain
- Contract execution is profit-guaranteed before deployment
- No runtime address validation for gas efficiency

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Memory Usage**: Minimized through elimination of extra collections
- **Time Complexity**: Linear execution path without redundant loops
- **Gas Efficiency**: Direct execution without intermediate checks
- **Code Footprint**: Maximum function reusability (2+ consumers per function)
